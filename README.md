Contains some of the coursework completed that I thought would be relevant

ColoringPane - This is a JavaFX program that displays a rudimentary drawing application. The assignment file creates the actual window whereas the SketchPane creates the borderpane, buttons, event handlers, and all of the functionality behind each of the children.

Heap_Function_Project - This is a project completed for my Data Structures and Algorithms class. This C++ program takes in user input to initialize and tinker with a heap data object, the specifics of the project are mostly in the local README file
